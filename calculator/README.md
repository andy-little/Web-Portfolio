### Notes
This project could benifit from the css being tidied up. This was my first attempt at building a site with css and as such the code is not maintainable and could benifit from a complete overhaul. If the site were to be developed further the login system would need to be made secure as currently it is very basic for demo purposely only. Some of the forms could also do with redesigning to be simpler and more user friendly.
